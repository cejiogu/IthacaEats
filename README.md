## Introduction
Are you a resident of Ithaca, New York, that has been looking to explore the culinary options around you? Introducing IthacaEats â€” an essential app for residents and visitors alike of the Ithaca community to effortlessly explore the city's diverse restaurant scene. Discover the local favorites, as well as the obscure treasures that Ithaca has to offer, all through this one convenient platform.  

## Description

_IthacaEats_ is an app that allows its users to:
- Scroll through a collection of local restaurants in and around CollegeTown, Ithaca, New York
- Read information about a specific restaurant, as selected by the user
- Create a review for any specific restaurant(s)

## Development
### Motivation
I came up with the idea for this application during my first semester at Cornell. At the time, I had not explored the many restaurants that surrounded my school. Realizing this, I came up with the idea of creating an app to consolidate various restaurants, as well as to cater to my own dining preferences by referring me to restaurants that my friends liked.

### Challenges
Understanding the frontend portion of the application proved especially challenging, since this was my first time working with Kotlin and Android Studio. Notably, the actual Kotlin language was easier to understand than the logic to AndroidStudio's GUIs, as the Kotlin language was reminiscent of Java, while the GUI aspect was entirely new. After spending time to especially study AndroidStudio, I became more comfortable with using views.

The development of this application likewise encouraged me to further review my knowledge of relational databases, especially in regards to implementing them using SQLAlchemy. I particularly had to review several parameters for the ```relationship()``` (namely the ```back_populates``` and the ```secondary``` parameters).

### Insights
### Aspirations
- Implement authentication feature into backend of application
- Implement feature to use multiple labels to sort restaurants
- Implement upvoting/downvoting feature to review system
- Include time and date on reviews
- Implement feature to sort reviews by relevance (amount of upvotes) or by recency  

## How to Use
